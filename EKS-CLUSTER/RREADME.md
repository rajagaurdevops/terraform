# üöÄ Amazon EKS Cluster Setup using Terraform

This project automates the creation of an **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** cluster using **Terraform**.  
It provisions all required AWS resources ‚Äî including VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway, Route Tables, IAM Roles, Security Groups, EKS Cluster, and Node Groups.

## üß† What is Amazon EKS?

**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** is a fully managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS.  
It allows you to run Kubernetes applications in the AWS cloud or on-premises without having to manage the Kubernetes control plane yourself.

EKS automatically handles:
- Kubernetes master node availability & scalability
- Security patches and updates
- Integration with AWS services (IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, ALB, etc.)

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

| Tool | Minimum Version | Purpose |
|------|------------------|---------|
| [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) | v1.5+ | Infrastructure as Code |
| [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) | v2+ | Interact with AWS |
| [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) | Latest | Manage Kubernetes cluster |
| [eksctl (optional)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html) | Latest | Additional EKS management |
| AWS Account | ‚Äî | To deploy infrastructure |
| IAM User/Role with permissions | ‚Äî | To provision resources |

---

## üîë Required IAM Permissions

The user executing Terraform must have **sufficient AWS IAM permissions** to create and manage EKS and its dependencies.

Minimum recommended policies:

- `AmazonEKSClusterPolicy`
- `AmazonEKSServicePolicy`
- `AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy`
- `AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy`
- `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`
- `AmazonVPCFullAccess`
- `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
- `IAMFullAccess`
- `CloudWatchFullAccess`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If your user **does not have these permissions**, Terraform will fail with `AccessDenied` or `UnauthorizedOperation` errors when creating resources such as IAM roles, EKS cluster, or EC2 nodes.

You can ask your AWS admin to attach these managed policies to your IAM user or role before running Terraform.
